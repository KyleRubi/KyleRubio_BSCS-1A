      <h2>My Achievement</h2>
      <p>
        This is my only achievement so far since I don’t really participate much in school events,
        but hey — at least I got Honors in graduating Senior High!
      </p>

      <p>This was when I finally received my certificate of recognition for "With Honors".</p>

      <p>It’s somehow nostalgic to compare an 11-year difference between my younger and older self.</p>

      <p>Jan 16, 2025 — when I took my Senior High graduation picture.</p>
      <p>
        It all feels so sudden now that I think about it — a yesterday child to a tomorrow adult.
        Pretty nostalgic, if you ask me.
